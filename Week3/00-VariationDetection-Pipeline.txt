!READ THIS: Used mm9 assembly for reference. This caused problems in downstream analysis, perhaps due to new version of snpeff cannot supporting mm9 build.  

Data is paired-end Illumina for 3 mouse lines
for Chr 4, 7 and 11

Goal: Identify Variants between mutants and control
"""

1. Map reads; FASTQ > BAM
## assign each sample a read group when mapping so they can be recognized

need reference genome:
Download here: http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/mm9/chromosomes/
use bwa mem
bwa mem -R 'readname_sample' 
    
    1 Index reference file (for 3 files)
    cat <genome4> <gen7> <gen11> > totalgenome.fa
    bwa index <totalgenome.fa>
    
    2 Align reads and set a readgroup
    bwa mem -R "@RG\tID:1526_007\tSM:mouse" 
        Reference/chr4-7-11.fa Seq_Data2/1526_007_LA.region.fq | samtools view -Sb > 1526_007.bam 
    bwa mem -R '183-005-NB' ...
    bwa mem -R '1449_002' ...
    
    3. Sort bam file
    samtools sort 1526_007.bam -o 1526_007.sort.bam 
    

(mem - fast maximal matching then does extension, which works well for long reads)
(at 50 bp, youre better off using the older non-mem option)

3. snpEff results
4. txt file telling you the consequences of each variant
