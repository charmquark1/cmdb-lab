Analyze chom conf capture data

find nucleotide sequences of fragments

1. Start with paired-end seq of Hi-C fragments
2. Align reads
3. Assign reads to parental genome
4. Assign to Restriction Fragment 

STEPS:

HiFive. 
1. Normalize data
Use HiFive to remove primer-specific biases
	a.  
	
Inputs: align ends separately (not paired)

Align reads
bwa_mem - align_reads.py
pair reads, resolving chimeric reads - sam2raw.py
normalization : HiFive
call domains 
very careful about whether you can call point interactions

Outputs: Nora.fcd   Nora.fcp   Nora.frags

##Heatmaps. Input fcp 5C file, output png graph
hifive 5c-heatmap 

hifive 5c-heatmap Nora.fcp 02-Out_frag.heat -i 02_fragOut.png -d fragment

enrichment = log(count/expected) 
* run fragments not bins
for each set of fragments

which positions the CTCF lines up with
inside heat file, you have boundaries for each read
You can eliminate positions that dont have CTCF (only have few bins left)
Look at each bins that have the highest value
