The motif with the strongest significance is the canonical CTCF motif, as found in JASPAR. It has an e-value of magnitude 10**(-223).
This motif is also known to have significant association with INSM1 and btd, but this association is not as strong as CTCF.

There is another enriched motif that was calculate, but annotation was not found in the JASPAR database.
