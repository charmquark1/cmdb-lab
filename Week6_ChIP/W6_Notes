(ChIP seq)

finding regions that are enriched for TFs
motif discovery, to define the affinity for types of motifs to that sequence

MACS: peak caller
- give it a sonificatio size (b), then a fold enrichment to look for. 
- fold enrichment is 42. take a window thats twice our soni size. go for windows that have 32 times

distinguish between high binding and easily fragmented. 
- control and treated and neg control?
- MACS will compare and determine significance of calls

Controlling for multiple testing:
- Statistical significance for genomewide studies, introduced FDR

4 data sets, fastq files
	2 cell types: G1E (mouse ES, GATA1 null), ER4
	GATA1 master regulator in hemapoeitosis (arrested in early stage)
	fusion protein thats activated by some treatment
	
	G1E --> ER4
	
	CTCF / input control to ChIP-seq

Quality Control
	adaptor trimming

Short Read alignment

Peak Calling:

Find changed in bindings
- bedtools -subtract

Motif Finding
- meme chip
take 100 of strongest peaks and find enrichment
Peaks (100  bp), 20 bp is TF binding site
